What kind of relationship are you both
exactly in?

[0004]
Miharu Shimizu

That is without asking. Of course it's--

[0005]
Minami Shimada
**********
There's no relationship!
There's nothing between me and Miharu!
All of these are just her delusions!

You're lying! You're the one delusional!

No! Those are your delusions!

Ahh...My poor Onee-Sama! You've been
poisoned by the Class F idiots.
But that's fine, Miharu will cure you!
